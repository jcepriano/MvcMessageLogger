## About
MvcMessageLogger was developed to allow users the ability to write down and track messages within their profile. Users can create their accounts and 
write out messages with a little bit of data for each message.

The time spent working on this application was mostly back-end logic using C#. The front-end was built solely with HTML. There is currently no additional CSS
added to the project. Any and all CSS was generated by Microsoft when the project was first made.
